# typed-video [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/videolang/typed-video.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/videolang/typed-video)

A prototype typed version of `#lang video`

Typed Video currently only works with Video `v0.1`.

Subsequent Video versions use different video lengths (seconds vs frames) and would require a different type system that uses real numbers instead of integers.

Requires Racket 6.10 or higher.
